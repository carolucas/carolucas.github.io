        A native of Cary, North Carolina, I attended <a href="www.chapman.edu">Chapman University</a> in Orange, California and then spent the next four years traveling the world and living in various places. I've processed coffee in Kona, Hawaii, visited women's microfinance groups in Quito, Ecuador and <a href=www.berdbears.com>developed an e-commerce business for a women's cooperative in Berd, Armenia.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        With a diverse array of experiences, what links it all together? I was on a quest to learn about entrepreneurship and how businesses develop around the world, whether it was exporting specialized coffee from Hawaii, or using microloans to open a local restaurant in an Ecuadorian coastal village, or developing a product line of specialized handicrafts in Armenia. In my own personal search to find out what I can do in my own small way to alleviate global povery, I came to the conclusion of business. Business means money, and money means economic empowerment, and economic empowerment means freedom.

        So now that I've seen and experienced these things, where did it lead me? On a quest to gain the skills required to make myself a valuable asset to people who are starting a business. I realized that I while I had the resourcefulness, creativity and problem-solving skills, I lacked the in-depth technical skills required for working in a startup. So here I am, learning how to code html (look at my website!) so that I can become a better marketer and work for an organization with a social mission that I care about.

        A native of Cary, North Carolina, I attended <a href="www.chapman.edu">Chapman University</a> in Orange, California and then spent the next four years traveling the world and living in various places. I've processed coffee in Kona, Hawaii, visited women's microfinance groups in Quito, Ecuador and <a href=www.berdbears.com>developed an e-commerce business for a women's cooperative in Berd, Armenia.</a>

    <p>
        With a diverse array of experiences, what links it all together? I was on a quest to learn about entrepreneurship and how businesses develop around the world, whether it was exporting specialized coffee from Hawaii, or using microloans to open a local restaurant in an Ecuadorian coastal village, or developing a product line of specialized handicrafts in Armenia. In my own personal search to find out what I can do in my own small way to alleviate global povery, I came to the conclusion of <em>business</em). Business means money, and money means economic empowerment, and economic empowerment means freedom.

        So now that I've seen and experienced these things, where did it lead me? On a quest to gain the skills required to make myself a valuable asset to people who are starting a business. I realized that I while I had the flexibility, creativity and problem-solving skills, I lacked the in-depth technical skills required for working in a startup. So here I am, learning how to code html (look at my website!) so that I can become a better marketer and work for an organization with a social mission that I care about.
